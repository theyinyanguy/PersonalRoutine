Why do you need API Gateways?
For enterprise who develop and maintain APIs, there is a lot of code realted to functionalities which is redundant and is required for each of the APIs exposed irrepective of, it being internal or public. Let's have a look at some of these functionalities.
* Authentication - One of the most common functionality of the APIs.It is the mechanism thorugh which API validates the user request. OAuth2, API-Key(Bearer), mTLS(or certificate based) and Basic Authentication are most common ways to authenticate an API request. If you have a huge external audience or clients that access the API you typically would like to outsource or seperate parts of this functionality. If the API returns data specific to the user then, this functionality will be required in the API.
* Rate limiting/Throttling - This is the functionality where you would it to limit the rate at which the API is invoked and if it is invoked beyond a certain limit , you would like to limit or restrict the execution of the API key. This functionality is typically dynamic, it either changes with time or depends on the plan or the subscription that the developer has subscribed to.
* Additional Layer of Security - API gateway physially/logicaly seperates the servers which is responsible for the execution of the API, there by protecting it from attach vectors like SQL injection, XML Parsers and Denial-of-service attacks.
* Protocol Management - It provides an option to seperate the external protocol(from client to API Gateway) from the Internal protocol(From the API gateway to internal service). The developer can choose to have protobuf or AMQP but the external protocol can be HTTP or REST or SOAP.
* Authorization - While this is similar to authenitcation, this is the functionality that allows for the definition of the access control policy. For REST APIs scope and XACML are popular standards.
* Simplify the Architecture - If your application has a large number of microservices, it is a good practice to restrict the access to the service from a single logical point i.e. API gateway. This ensures that internal network is not exposed to the external network.

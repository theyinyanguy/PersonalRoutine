Why [[writing]] ?
I think [[writing]] is like focusing, may be meditating . It is listening to yourself. And no matter what you do, you need to listen to yourself. Once you learn to listen to yourself, you can do whatever you do better.
I am very facinated with the idea of creating something. More interesting is the idea that you create  or do something once and it keeps selling or it lives on for ever. Think of a speech which you give once but is delivered again and again. Writing like podcasting,youtubing is very repeatable. Some day it will be good to have a book which I can publish online and it keeps selling everyday for years. I admire writers like Chetan bhagat, Seth Godin who have written successful books which keep selling for years. Seth Godin is very inspiring because he writes atleast once blog everyday. I would like to do it too and hence today I begin this routine to write atleast once daily. Getting back to why is writing important to me. I wish to have an online blog where I can voice my opinion and write about my thoughts published on my personal website([www.puneetwrites.com]). The flipslide of this is I will have my opnion.
So where do I write, I don't need a fancy tool to get started. I tried using this web app but it seemed buggy, so I decided to use [[Obsidian]]. It will be good to lean markdown and use github to store them
